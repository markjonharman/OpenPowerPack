# OpenPowerPack
Open Source hardware and software for 2S-4S LiPo Battery Controller

When working on powering an mobile embedded open source project I realized there seemed to be a gap in the available open source hardware out there for making a USB-C power pack/power bank. Most projects focus on a smaller single LiPo or are focused on the substatially larger homewall type applications. Instead, this PCBA allows you to make a 2S-4S battery pack with fast charging and very high output power capabilities that can be easily be embedded in a design. The original vision was for supporting Raspberry Pi5 based systems but that is not where it has to end.
